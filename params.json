{"name":"FlexDM","tagline":"Flexible Data Mining using WEKA","body":"##Overview\r\nPerforming massive data mining experiments with multiple datasets and methods is a common task faced by many research groups. WEKA is a machine learning package designed to facilitate this task by providing tools that allow researchers to select from a plethora of classification methods and specific test strategies. Despite its popularity, the current WEKA Experimenter, has limitations that impact its usability: lack of flexibility for parameter ranges; difficult setup for multi-core parallelisation; results are not saved until the last test has concluded by default; and the XML schema is difficult to read. FlexDM implements an interface with WEKA to run batch processing tasks in a simple and intuitive way. In an XML file hundreds of tests can be defined to run on several datasets. FlexDM allows those tests to be executed in parallel to take advantage of multi-core processors, significantly increasing usability. Results are saved incrementally for better robustness and reliability.\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\nFlexDM runs on Windows, OSX and Linux.\r\nFlexDM requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 7 or above, which\r\ncan be downloaded from [here.](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)\r\n\r\n##Running FlexDM\r\n- Download FlexDM as a [zip](https://github.com/madiflannery/FlexDM/zipball/current_release) or [tarball](https://github.com/madiflannery/FlexDM/tarball/current_release)\r\n- Create an XML file using the specifications described in the User Manual. A template is available as a part of the FlexDM download.\r\n- Using command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Ubuntu/Mac), cd to the FlexDM directory.\r\n- Run FlexDM by using the following command:\r\n    java -jar FlexDM.jar <Name of XML file> <Number of cores> <Results folder>\r\nwhere <Number of cores> and <Results folder> are optional arguments, and the order of these arguments does not matter.\r\n- The results will be stored in a Results subdirectory, within the FlexDM directory.\r\n","google":"UA-58632142-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
